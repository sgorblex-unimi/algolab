# AlgoLab
This repo contains my code form the Algorithms and Data Structures Workshop at Universit√† Statale di Milano, academic year 2020/2021.

Since I like to challenge myself, I tried to set up a small C library of data structures (see `include/` and `src/`). More of that challenging in the [algo-csort](https://github.com/sgorblex-unimi/algo-csort) repo (and in my other repos).

Some of the content of the repository is based Kyle Loudon's "Mastering algorithms with C", published by O'Reilly in 1999, which I highly suggest to take a look at.

See [TODO.md](TODO.md) for cool stuff I've not done (yet).
