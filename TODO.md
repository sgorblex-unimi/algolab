# TODO - algolab

## Data structures
- [ ] bindings for undirected graphs (as directed with arcs in both directions between vertices)
- [ ] Go-like slices

## Improvements
- [ ] iterators (object-oriented style)
- [ ] use pointers to structs instead of structs for the main types
- [ ] conversions: tree to array, heap to tree, array to heap


Since I already took the exam a while ago, it's not very likely that I'll take the time to implement these TODOs. You can try it yourself though :)
